# Dog breed classification

## Overview

For this project a pipeline was built that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Specifically, given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. This project was submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree.
